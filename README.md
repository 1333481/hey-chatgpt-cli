# Hey Chatbot

Hey is a powerful chatbot for the command line that uses ChatGPT to generate commands based on natural language input.

## Installation
Pipx is a tool that allows you to install and run Python packages in isolated environments. This means that you can install Hey without worrying about conflicting dependencies or affecting other Python packages on your system.

To install Hey via pipx, you can use the following command:

```
pipx install hey-gpt
```
Once Hey is installed, you can run it from anywhere on your system by typing `hey` in your terminal.

(see pipx https://pypa.github.io/pipx/)

Alternatively, you can install Hey using pip:

```
pip install hey
```

## Usage

```
hey
```
To use Hey, simply type in your question or command and Hey will start a chat session and generate commands. It always asks to confirm before execution.
